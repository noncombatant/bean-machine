<h2>Searching</h2>

<p>Bean Machine’s search feature is fairly simple.</p>

<ul>

<li><code><strong>james brown</strong></code> will match all items that contain
both “james” and “brown”, anywhere in their metadata. This includes substrings,
so a hypothetical artist named Jameson Brownington will also match. This also
means that a hypothetical record named <em>Brown</em> by the band James would
match.</li>

<li><code><strong>"james brown"</strong></code> will match all items that
contain the quoted phrase anywhere in their metadata. Jameson Brownington and
<em>Brown</em> by James no longer match, although James Brownington still
would.</li>

<li>You can also prefix terms with <code><strong>-</strong></code> to negate
them: <code><strong>"james brown" -popcorn</strong></code> matches all items
that contain the phrase anywhere in their metadata, but will exclude items that
match “popcorn”.</li>

<li>Each item has in its metadata the date it was added to the catalog, in the
format YYYY-MM-DD. This means you can search for items that were added at a
given time, by searching for e.g. <code><strong>2018-03-02</strong></code>,
<code><strong>2018-03</strong></code>, or even just
<code><strong>2018-</strong></code>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Prefetching</h2>

<p>When you don’t have really good, always-on connectivity (like when walking or
driving in areas with spotty cellular coverage), Bean Machine may pause playback
for lack of song data.</p>

<p>To alleviate this problem, Bean Machine will prefetch 3 items from your
current search results, and then will fetch 1 more item each time you play one.
This way, you should usually have a ‘buffer’ of already-downloaded songs even
when you have a connectivity gap.</p>
