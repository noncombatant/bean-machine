<h2>Searching</h2>

<p>Bean Machine’s search feature is fairly simple.</p>

<ul>

<li><code><strong>james brown</strong></code> will match all items that contain
both “james” and “brown”, anywhere in their metadata. This includes substrings,
so a hypothetical artist named Jameson Brownington will also match. This also
means that a hypothetical record named <em>Brown</em> by the band James would
match.</li>

<li><code><strong>"james brown"</strong></code> will match all items that
contain the phrase anywhere in their metadata. Jameson Brownington and
<em>Brown</em> by James no longer match, although James Brownington still
would.</li>

<li>You can also prefix terms with <code><strong>-</strong></code> to negate
them: <code><strong>"james brown" -popcorn</strong></code> matches all items
that contain the phrase anywhere in their metadata, but will exclude items that
match “popcorn”.</li>

</ul>
