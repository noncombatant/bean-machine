<h1>Bean Machine</h1>

<p>Bean Machine is a web application that plays audio and video in a browser
from files served from a server. The server can be on a local intranet or on the
internet. This software package contains both components: the server software,
and the JavaScript and HTML that run in the browser.</p>

<h2>How To Install And Run Bean Machine</h2>

<h3>1: Install The Go Language</h3>

<p>The Bean Machine server component is written in a programming language called
Go. Go does not (yet) come installed by default as part of your computer’s
operating system, but you can install it for free.</p>

<p>To run Bean Machine, you will need to <a
href="https://golang.org/dl/"><strong>download the Go programming
language</strong></a> for your computer. Download the <strong>latest stable
version</strong> of the <strong>installer package</strong>, and install it.</p>

<h3>2: Build The Server</h3>

<p>Then you’ll need to build the server executable for your machine.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, open a command shell terminal. (That’s Terminal on
macOS, or CMD.EXE on Windows.)</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, change the shell’s working directory to the location
of this <code>readme.html</code> file. This example assumes you’ve downloaded it
into your <code>Downloads</code> folder, which you probably have.</p>

<table>

<tr>
<th>macOS And Linux</th>
<th>Windows</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<pre>
$ <strong>cd ~/Downloads/bean-machine</strong>
$ <strong>go build .</strong>
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
$ <strong>cd %HOMEPATH%\Downloads\bean-machine</strong>
$ <strong>go build .</strong>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>The result of this process will be a file named <code>bean-machine</code>
(macOS and Linux) or <code>bean-machine.exe</code> (Windows). This is the
Bean Machine server program. It is a <em>command line program</em>, meaning it
has a textual interface instead of a graphical user interface. Its purpose is to
scan your music collection to build a catalog, and then to serve that catalog
and your music to web browsers. The actual music-playing user interface appears
in the browser.</p>

<h3>3. Run The Server</h3>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, run <code>bean-machine</code>, to tell it to build
the music catalog and run the web server. Tell it the pathname of your music
directory. On macOS, many Linux systems, and Windows, that is most likely to be
your <code>Music</code> folder.</p>

<table>

<tr>
<th>macOS And Linux</th>
<th>Windows</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<pre>
$ <strong>./bean-machine -m ~/Music</strong>
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
$ <strong>.\bean-machine.exe -m %HOMEPATH\Music</strong>
</pre>
</tr>

</table>

<p>The output should look something like this (on all platforms):</p>

<pre>
2016/11/19 14:20:56 buildCatalog: 1000 items
2016/11/19 14:20:56 buildCatalog: 2000 items
2016/11/19 14:20:56 buildCatalog: 3000 items
2016/11/19 14:20:57 Starting the web server. Point your browser to any of these addresses:
2016/11/19 14:20:57     https://localhost:8443/
2016/11/19 14:20:57     https://127.0.0.1:8443/
2016/11/19 14:20:57     https://192.168.1.100:8443/
</pre>

<p>The web addresses <code>bean-machine</code> prints are quite likely to be
different on your computer than in the example above (although every computer
calls itself <code>localhost</code> and <code>127.0.0.1</code>).</p>

<h4>Important Note</h4>

<p>Finally, note that when you browse to your Bean Machine server, your browser
will warn you about the ‘invalid’ server security certificate that Bean Machine
uses. (Bean Machine creates a new certificate for itself as part of starting the
server.) Normally, you shouldn’t expect to see invalid certificates on real,
public internet sites.</p>

<p>But for running servers (like Bean Machine) on your own computer at home,
it’s OK, and you can click through this warning without hurting anything.
Although you know you are talking to your own server, the browser doesn’t ‘know’
that, and so it warns you out of an abundance of caution.</p>

<p>For public web sites like facebook.com or google.com, such a warning would be
important and real, and you should not click through it.</p>
