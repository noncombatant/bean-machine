<h1>Bean Machine</h1>

<p>Bean Machine is a web application that plays audio and video in a browser
from files served from a server. The server can be on a local intranet or on the
Internet. This software package contains both components: the server software,
and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that run in the browser.</p>

<h2>How To Install And Run Bean Machine</h2>

<h3>1: Install The Go Language</h3>

<p>The Bean Machine server component is written in a programming language called
Go. Go does not (yet) come installed by default as part of your computer’s
operating system, but you can install it for free.</p>

<p>To run Bean Machine, you will need to <a
href="https://golang.org/dl/"><b>download the Go programming language</b></a>
for your computer. Download the <b>latest stable version</b> of the <b>installer
package</b>, and install it.</p>

<h3>2: Build The Server</h3>

<p>Then you’ll need to build the server executable for your machine.</p>

<p><b>First</b>, open a command shell terminal. (That’s Terminal on macOS, or
CMD.EXE on Windows.)</p>

<p><b>Second</b>, change the shell’s working directory to the location of this
<code>readme.html</code> file. This example assumes you’ve downloaded it into
your <code>Downloads</code> folder, which you probably have.</p>

<table>

<tr>
<th>macOS And Linux</th>
<th>Windows</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<pre>
$ <b>cd ~/Downloads/bean-machine</b>
$ <b>go build .</b>
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
C:...\&gt; <b>cd %HOMEPATH%\Downloads\bean-machine</b>
C:...\Downloads\bean-machine&gt; <b>go build .</b>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>The result of this process will be a file named <code>bean-machine</code>
(macOS and Linux) or <code>bean-machine.exe</code> (Windows). This is the Bean
Machine server program. It is a <i>command line program</i>, meaning it has a
textual interface instead of a graphical user interface. Its purpose is to scan
your music collection to build a catalog, and then to serve that catalog and
your music to web browsers. The actual music-playing user interface appears in
the browser.</p>

<h3>3. Run The Server</h3>

<p><b>Third</b>, run <code>bean-machine</code>, to tell it to build
the music catalog and run the web server. Tell it the pathname of your music
directory. On macOS, many Linux systems, and Windows, that is most likely to be
your <code>Music</code> folder.</p>

<table>

<tr>
<th>macOS And Linux</th>
<th>Windows</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<pre>
$ <b>./bean-machine -m ~/Music serve</b>
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
C:...\Downloads\bean-machine&gt; <b>.\bean-machine.exe -m %HOMEPATH\Music serve</b>
</pre>
</tr>

</table>

<p>The output should look something like this (on all platforms):</p>

<pre>
2016/11/19 14:20:56 buildCatalogFromWalk: start.
2016/11/19 14:20:56 buildCatalogFromWalk: this might take a while.
2016/11/19 14:30:27 Starting the web server. Point your browser to any of these addresses:
2016/11/19 14:30:27     https://localhost:1234/
2016/11/19 14:30:27     https://127.0.0.1:1234/
2016/11/19 14:30:27     https://192.168.1.100:1234/
</pre>

<p>The web addresses <code>bean-machine</code> prints might be different on your
computer than in the example above.</p>

<h4>Important Note</h4>

<p>Finally, note that when you browse to your Bean Machine server, your browser
will warn you about the ‘invalid’ server security certificate that Bean Machine
uses. Bean Machine creates a new certificate for itself as part of starting the
server, but the certificate has not been <i>signed</i> by an authority your
browser knows about. Normally, you shouldn’t expect to see invalid certificates
on real, public internet sites.</p>

<p>But for running servers (like Bean Machine) on your own computer at home,
it’s OK, and you can click through this warning without hurting anything.
Although you know you are talking to your own server, the browser doesn’t ‘know’
that, and so it warns you out of an abundance of caution.</p>

<p>(For public web sites like facebook.com or google.com, such a warning would
be important and real, and you should not click through it!)</p>
