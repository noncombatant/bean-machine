<h1>Implementation Notes</h1>

<h2>Client</h2>

<p>The client web application uses a deliberately simple (even simplistic)
design. The user interface is an infinite scroll of media items, with a playback
control panel at the top of the page. Search and catalog listing are the same
operation. Search is linear search over a sequence of media item metadata
records.</p>

<p>We represent the database (<var>catalog</var>) as UTF-8 text, with records
and fields delimited by special characters. (When generating the catalog, the
server escapes the delimiters if they appear in metadata text.)</p>

<p>To avoid memory allocation and copying, we search for and retrive metadata
for each media item by its offset in the database text, which remains unchanged.
We call the offset the <var>itemID</var>. To avoid UI jank, a Worker thread
computes search results. We only copy the catalog database from the main thread
to the Worker on the first search. (It would be nice to avoid this copy.)</p>

<p>The client is implemented as an HTML frame, a stylesheet, and 2 JavaScript
files (the main UI and the Worker). It uses no JS frameworks or CSS
preprocessors. The largest non-media resource is the catalog file, which
compresses well. My installation, with more than 71,000 media items, has a 1.6
MiB compressed catalog file (10.3 MiB uncompressed). Although this is large and
significantly impacts startup time, it is about an order of magnitude smaller
than an MP3 of a 4-minute song.</p>

<p>The client pre-fetches a few items after a search completes, and stores them
as Blobs. Sending the entire catalog to the client enables the client to search
for and play cached and pre-fetched content when offline. When the Writable File
or similar API becomes available, we can use that, and a client’s local copy of
the media store will gradually become a mirror of the server’s.</p>

<p>The code is a small collection of global data objects and plain functions
that operate on them and on the DOM. It makes no use of JavaScript classes or
custom HTML elements.</p>
